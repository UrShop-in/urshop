          <p>Hey everyone, I find it so refreshing to clear my mind before I start working for the day. It helps me refocus and recharge before I get started with my coding.</p>

          <p>There are multiple ways you can stay focused and motivated as a web developer, and as a beginner learning web development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">TAKE REGULAR BREAKS</h2>

          <p>It’s important to take a break every 20–30 minutes. We need to give our eyes a rest and let our tiny brain cells recharge a little. Even if it’s a 5-minute break — It’s a good idea to take a little breather twice per hour. As someone learning about web development, you will be very focused and concentrated on learning lots. Let your brain absorb that information, by doing one of these:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Take a short walk around your house/office area or outside</li>
            <li>Stretch and move your body, especially by standing</li>
            <li>Listen to music or a meditation</li>
            <li>Chat with a fellow coworker or with a friend</li>
            <li>Eat a snack or drink a hydrating beverage</li>
            <li>Regular drinking of cold water keeps your mind fresh and awake</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="section-heading">DON’T TRY AND LEARN EVERYTHING IN ONE GO</h2>

          <p>As a beginner, you’ll want to go crazy and learn everything in one go, I know, I do it too, still! But a little bit of advice… Learn Lecture by lecture/part by part. Learn from one lecture, practice what you’ve learned, maybe even go back to that lecture and repeat it, then move on. Your first online course, you may have slowed the pace down of speaking and demonstrating to help you follow along properly, and really promote high-value teaching and learning. It’ll be important to not rush through each lecture but to go slow and implement your learning by practicing.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">COMMUNICATION</h2>

          <p>As you are learning, and also when you become a web developer or freelancer, it’s very important to keep your communication levels high with friends/co-workers or your mentor/instructor. For example, when you are learning in your first online course, seek help from the author via reaching out to them on Messenger, Email, or through the Course Dashboard, I will be talking. Why is communication important? It allows you to get help on a certain problem or ask questions about a topic. It will also reassure you that you’re doing the right thing and give you confidence in yourself as a web developer.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Don’t try to enroll in more than one course at a time</h2>

          <p>At the beginner stage of web development, we hear a lot of technical words that lead us to research about it. I myself used to search for free courses around the internet and start learning altogether. Later I realize that this procedure isn’t helping me in any way instead of it I was jumbling things inside my mind. So I would suggest you to please learn everything but one at a time. That’s what makes you more productive.</p>

          <p>Many more things are lined up "</p>
